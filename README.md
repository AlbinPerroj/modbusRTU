# modbusRTU

This is a desktop application developed using C# and WPF.

# usage

It is used to implement modbus rtu master node and test modbus rtu slave nodes.

# why I developed it
 
I developed this software to help me out with an other development 
I was doing at that time, which is developing a library in C language 
to implement the modbus protocol in stm32 microcontrollers 
using their uart module (repo in my github: modbus-rtu-stm32).
